# Waiting on Kyle

The orchestrator writes here (`ORCHESTRATOR.md`); Kyle works the list at a check-in and ticks items in his own commits.
One item per entry: `- [ ] <date> <kind>: <what>`, kinds `uat`, `record`, `question`, `look` (something the
orchestrator wants his eyes on, not blocking). An entry carries enough context to make the high-level decision from
its paragraph alone (what it is, what was decided or found, what his answer changes, the recommended answer) and
deep links (a path with its heading or line, a record id, a PR) to the artifact or section for a deep-dive review.
Kyle's own lines go under `## Steering`.

## Open

- [ ] 2026-10-29 record: **put your own commit on D-0011.** What D-0011 decides: when a task's steps are opened in the
  activity drawer, the parent agent may read a sub-agent's transcript to show the child's steps, after first checking
  that the person asking owns the parent chat. That read crosses the sub-agent's storage boundary, so it is a one-way
  door that only you accept. It is marked accepted today, but the acceptance was relayed through the session's user on
  2026-10-26, never committed by you, and the verifier (rightly, per Q9) keeps flagging anything that rests on it.
  What to do: make any one-line edit to the record's Context and commit it yourself; that is the whole item. Nothing
  else is waiting on it, and F14 is already on main. If instead you do not want the parent reading a child's transcript,
  set the record to `rejected` and say so under Steering; F14's transcript half then comes out. Deep dive:
  [the record](../decisions/0011-subagent-transcript-read.md),
  [Q9](QUESTIONS.md#q9-f14-2026-10-27-may-a-session-record-kyles-acceptance-relayed-by-the-person-orchestrating-for-him),
  `test/workers/f14-activity-subagents.test.ts`.

- [ ] 2026-10-29 look: **the P1 reactions contract and its two deltas from Muse.** The interrogation of muse.ai on
  2026-10-29 found that every person reaction starts a Muse turn (a developer handoff block with a "nothing to do"
  escape), and that a person can react to their own message from the phone's ⋯ sheet. fletch keeps its shipped gate
  (a reaction wakes the agent only on a pending question; an ambient ❤️ rides in the next envelope) as delta 1, a
  two-way call the orchestrator took: no model spend per ambient reaction, at the cost that a ❤️ on personal news gets
  no reply until you write again. Delta 6 (own message reactable at phone width) is a finding fixed by F21, not a
  design choice. Say so if you want a wake per reaction instead, or own-message reactions kept. Deep dive:
  [Translation, deltas](contracts/P1-reactions.md#translation), [the finding against the dump brief](contracts/P1-reactions.md#clauses)
  (line "Finding against the dump brief"), [F21 in parts.md](parts.md#f21-reactions-a-persons-own-message-takes-no-reaction);
  evidence on your Mac under `docs/plan-v2/evidence/p1-reactions/` (`answers/step-*.md`, `step-*.png`).

- [ ] 2026-10-29 look: **the reactions specimen.** The owner-visible reactions surface, drawn from the muse.ai capture
  before F21 builds it (design §4.5): a chip that hangs off the bubble's inner corner (the person's a button that
  removes, the agent's a labelled image), the hover row and six-emoji picker on an agent message, a heart glyph in the
  warning colour for the care register, and the 390 sheets (an agent message: five reactions, More, Reply, Copy; your
  own message: Reply and Copy only). F21 draws it in the app without waiting; what you want changed lands as UAT on F21.
  Deep dive: the rendered page https://claude.ai/artifact/BnCGn9dkLDJByGgnzNEgNW (both themes, sheets inlined); the
  source is `packages/agent/src/design/fletch/ds/specimens/reactions.html`; the rules are the `Reactions (chat), F20` block in
  [`bundle.css`](../../packages/agent/src/design/fletch/ds/components/bundle.css); the check is
  `test/workers/f20-reactions-specimen.test.ts`; commit da209df.

- [ ] 2026-10-29 question: **Q10, stale briefs and counts, a read not a decision.** The dump brief
  `docs/briefs/reactions-dump-2026-10-23.md` read reactions as ambient only, and the design's §7 counts Muse's tools
  as 108 in 32 namespaces where the live `tools.json` holds 109 in 19 with 9 unavailable and no reaction function. The
  recommended answer: the briefs are deleted in the PR after F20 (design §5.1) and §7's count is corrected there; say
  so only if you would rather keep the briefs. Deep dive:
  [Q10](QUESTIONS.md#q10-f20-2026-10-29-the-dump-brief-and-the-designs-muse-counts-are-stale),
  [design §5.1 and §7](2026-10-29-parity-framework-design.md).
